This is a archive of all the project I build based on the comments I got under my post. 

**Real-life Python Automation Projects**

A collection of practical Python projects built from community suggestions. Each project focuses on pure Python automation tools and utilities that solve real-world problems.

**Guidelines**
- Pure Python implementations only (no web development) (maybe some 3rd party libs here and there)
- Practical automation and utility projects
- Intermediate-level complexity
- Real-world applications
- project idea should be universal, so anyone can download and use that tool 
- tools shall be CLI based
